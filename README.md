Hello Everyone!üëã

**Septocode 21** is a 21 days programming event for students to develop basic programming skills which will be helpful to them while working in various domains in future while inculcating a habit to code daily.üßëüíª

Starting from 21st September, all the contributors will be provided with simple programming questions, **one per day**, which can be written using any programming language such as C/C++/Java/Python or any language of preference and will be submitted **every day**. The contributor has to submit the **code** and the **output** generated through **google forms** which will be accepted after **thorough checking**. üë®‚Äçüíª



## Steps to Follow: ‚úçÔ∏è

- The question of each day will be available from the start of the day.
- The submission form will be open from 10:00am to 11:59pm each day.
- Check the question of the day in the GitHub repository. (You may download the question or fork the repository)
- Download the test cases file.
- You can then start working on the question.

 ## Submission Guidelines üìò	
- The google form mentioned below is where the code file and output file are to be submitted on a daily basis.‚è≤Ô∏è

  **Google form** - [submission_link](https://forms.gle/dNxfgsequegoQkH8A)

- To generate the output file, follow the below instructions in the command prompt:
  - Firstly, make sure that the code and input file are in the same directory.
  - Then from the directory, open command prompt.
  - Type the code shown below in the cmd for the language of your preference, to generate the output file to be submitted. This output should be the output of the test case (input_problem statement number.txt), e.g. - input_1.txt for day 1,  provided with the problem statement.
  
    **i.	For C++/C**

        g++/gcc file.cpp -o file.exe

        file.exe < ip.txt > op.txt

    **ii.	For Java**

        javac file.java 

        java file < ip.txt > op.txt

    **iii.	For Python**

        python file.py < ip.txt > op.txt
